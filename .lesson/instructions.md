# Plotting Binomial random variables

Now that you know how to generate binomial random variables lets make a scatter plot showing 100 random variables that are sampled from this distribution.

To complete this exercise you will need to:

- Write a function called `binomial` that takes `n` (the number of trials to perform) and `p` (the probability of success) as arguments using what you learned in the previous exercise.

- Use this function and what you know about loops, lists and plotting to make a scatter plot showing 100 binomial random variables.  The x-coordinates of the points in your plot should be 1, 2, 3 etc and the y-coordinates should be the values of 100 binomial random variables that have the n parameter set equal to the global variable `num` and the p parameter set to the global variable `prob`.  The x-axis label of the graph should be "Index" and the y-axis label should be "random variable".
